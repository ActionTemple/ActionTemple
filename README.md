**About Me**

CS graduate with a background in teaching transitioning to software development.
Inspired by enthusiasm for the 8 and 16 bit era of computing, my final project for CS50p was a fully functioning, moderately complex text adventure, The Big House, which playtesters (my friends) have reported sufficiently challenging not to have been able to complete in an evening.
You can have a go at the Flask web version [here](https://andrew-waddington.onrender.com/big-house), or watch a video demo [here](https://youtu.be/hfWx1SkJ-mA).

**What I'm doing at the moment**

Right now I'm in the early stages of CS50x, studying C.
Keeping with the retro-computing theme, I'm working on a scrolling ASCII text demo, based on Pyfiglet fonts, where the user will be able to input their own message and change the colour theme and scroll speed.

**What I Work With:**
- **Python** - primary language, comfortable with OOP, libraries, testing
- **C** - currently studying via CS50x for fundamentals 
- **Javascript/HTML/CSS** - some practice with these - see [Scrolling Demo](https://github.com/ActionTemple/Scrolling-Demo-Javascript) 
- **Tools** - Git, VS Code, Linux environment

**What I Bring Beyond Code:**
- Clear communication and documentation (16 years teaching)
- Quality assurance mindset (exam assessor/IV)
- International collaboration (worked across 4 countries)
- Ability to work under pressure (OFSTED inspections, tight deadlines)
